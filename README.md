# Diabetic_Retinopathy_Detection_Using-CNN

Diabetic Retinopathy Detection
This project demonstrates the detection of diabetic retinopathy using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on the Diabetic Retinopathy 224x224 (2019 Data) dataset sourced from Kaggle.

Dataset
Source: Kaggle: Diabetic Retinopathy 224x224 (2019 Data)
Description:
This dataset contains preprocessed images of retinal scans resized to 224x224 pixels.
It is categorized into five classes corresponding to the severity of diabetic retinopathy:
0: No diabetic retinopathy
1: Mild diabetic retinopathy
2: Moderate diabetic retinopathy
3: Severe diabetic retinopathy
4: Proliferative diabetic retinopathy
